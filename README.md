# Single_Fault_Vibration_Analysis_Using_MachineLearning
This project discusses vibration analysis for a single fault simulation using the IMU present on the Arduino Nano BLE 33. Data is collected and after data augmentation a robust data set is uploaded to edgeimpulse for training. The trained model is downloaded as an arduino library through which weights are accessed for realtime prediction.
